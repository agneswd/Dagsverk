# Known gaps

## Phase 0 platform proof

- Current behavior: The pinned preview builds, launches, sets its native title, resizes under Niri, and exits cleanly on Linux.
- Expected parity: Input, clipboard, focus, resize, and native launch work on Windows and Linux.
- Reason incomplete: Windows CI and launch checks remain. Automated clipboard interaction did not produce reliable evidence, so the clipboard check remains open.
- Files involved: `gpui/crates/dagsverk-app`, `.github/workflows/gpui.yml`.
- Proposed solution: Complete local Wayland checks and Windows CI.
- Test needed: Manual platform checklist and CI release builds.
